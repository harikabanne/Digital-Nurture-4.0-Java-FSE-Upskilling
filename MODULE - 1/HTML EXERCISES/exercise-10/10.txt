Objective:
Practice using Chrome DevTools and VS Code features to:

Inspect layout elements

Modify styles live

View console errors and logs

Add breakpoints to JavaScript code

Watch variable values during script execution
Steps to Debug Using Chrome DevTools:
1. Open DevTools:
Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" or press Ctrl + Shift + I (Windows) / Cmd + Option + I (Mac)

2. Use "Elements" Tab:
Check the layout structure.

You can modify styles live here. Try changing padding, color, font-size, etc.

Example: Change the header background color.

3. Use "Console" Tab:
Click the button on the page ("Click Me") and check the console.

Youâ€™ll see:

Uncaught TypeError: output.textCont is undefined

Uncaught ReferenceError: console is not defined

These errors help you identify the bugs in the script.

4. Use "Sources" Tab:
Open the script section.

Set a breakpoint on the line inside showMessage() and the add() function.

Click the button again and step through the code using "Step Over" and "Step Into" controls.

5. Check "Network" Tab (Optional):
Shows that the image missing.jpg was not found (404 error).

Can be used to test whether resources like CSS or JS are loading correctly.

6. Use VS Code (Optional):
Open this HTML file in VS Code.

Hover over variables to inspect types and values.

Use the built-in Live Server extension for live preview and console integration.
