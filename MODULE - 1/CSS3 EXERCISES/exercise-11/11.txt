1. Use Chrome’s Device Toolbar to Simulate Screen Sizes
Open your webpage in Google Chrome.

Press F12 or right-click and select Inspect to open Developer Tools.

Click the Toggle device toolbar button (icon that looks like a phone/tablet) or press Ctrl + Shift + M.

This lets you switch between different device screen sizes or set custom sizes.

Resize and observe how your site responds (especially your media queries).

You can select from preset devices like iPhone, iPad, Galaxy, etc.

2. Inspect Applied Styles and Test Different Values Live
While in DevTools, select an element in the Elements tab.

In the Styles pane, you can:

See all CSS rules applied.

Toggle rules on/off by checking/unchecking.

Edit properties and see changes live.

This helps debug problems like incorrect colors, missing styles, or wrong layout.

3. Use Network Tab to Check External CSS Loading
In DevTools, go to the Network tab.

Reload the page (F5).

Look for your CSS file (styles.css) in the list.

Confirm it loads successfully (status 200) and no errors like 404.

If CSS is not loading, the page will not style correctly — fix your file paths.

How to test:
Open in browser.

Open DevTools.

Toggle device toolbar.

Resize window to less than 600px width and observe that the header text color changes to red and font size shrinks.

Use the Styles pane to disable or modify properties to see changes live.

Check the Network tab to confirm styles.css loads without errors.
